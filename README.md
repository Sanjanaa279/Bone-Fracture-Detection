# Bone-Fracture-Detection

Bone fractures are prevalent injuries caused by various factors, including accidents, sports 
injuries, and medical conditions like osteoporosis. Traditional fracture detection methods, 
notably X-ray imaging, are associated with high costs and potential risks due to ionizing 
radiation exposure. In response, this paper presents a novel approach to fracture detection 
using sound waves generated by a mobile phone's vibrator. Through the application of the 
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) technique in MATLAB, the device analyzes sound wave 
signals to differentiate between healthy and fractured bones. This innovative solution offers a 
non-radiographic, cost-effective, and user-friendly alternative to conventional methods, 
promising improved accessibility and accuracy in fracture diagnosis. 
 
The proposed device leverages the computational capabilities of MATLAB to provide a 
portable and efficient means of fracture detection. By harnessing sound waves, which are 
safer than ionizing radiation, the device minimizes potential health risks for patients and 
healthcare professionals. Furthermore, the use of FFT analysis enables real-time processing 
of sound wave signals, allowing for rapid and accurate identification of fractures. This 
approach holds significant promise for enhancing fracture diagnosis, particularly in resource
limited settings where access to traditional imaging modalities may be limited. 
 
Experimental validation of the proposed device demonstrates its effectiveness in 
distinguishing between healthy and fractured bones. By comparing the frequency responses 
of sound waves, the device accurately detects the presence of fractures, providing valuable 
support for medical professionals in clinical settings. Moreover, its low-cost design and ease 
of use make it accessible to a wide range of users, including healthcare providers and 
individuals seeking self-assessment of fractures. Overall, this innovative approach to fracture 
detection offers a promising solution for improving healthcare outcomes and patient 
experiences.
